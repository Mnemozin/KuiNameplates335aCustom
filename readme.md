# Kui_Nameplates (260) for _WoTLK_.

## Fork of https://github.com/bkader/KuiNameplates-WoTLK/tree/main 

## Install:

1. [Download the package.](https://github.com/someweirdhuman/KuiNameplates335aCustom/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Requires custom fork of [Awesome_Wotlk](https://github.com/someweirdhuman/awesome_wotlk) and game patched with it
3. Place the folders `Kui_Nameplates`` Kui_Nameplates_Auras` to `Interface\AddOns`.
4. Enjoy!

## Changes
- Auras are always on nameplates and always updates
- Better performance
- Nameplates are created using unit added/removed events and auras update using these events
- Combatlog parsing is no longer so bad as there is new API to simply grab unit token from guid and map it better, no more assumptions
